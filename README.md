# Penny Auction Clone
Today we're using React to build our own Penny Auction website.
This repo contains a barebones React app and some images from
the popular Penny Auction website <http://www.quibids.com/>.

Your job is to create a component that encapsulates what one
penny auction looks like on the site.

Each penny auction has these properties:

* a title
* an image
* the time left in the auction
* the current price of the item
* the last user to bid on the item
* a "Bid Now" button

Make up some fake data to populate your component. We'll use these
components in a site later that hooks up the display of these auctions
to network requests so we see the auctions update live.
